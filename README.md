# GistIt: An AI Text Summarizer

* Built a full-stack application on Replit that allows users to enter or paste their long texts and get a summary in return.
* Used the Hugging Face API for summarizing text.
* Used Facebook's BART LARGE CNN model in particular.
* Used Postman to generate code and integrate APIs into the application.
